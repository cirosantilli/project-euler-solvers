# Dice Signaling Game Solver

This solution models Alice's choice of which dice to hide as a linear program. The key idea is to treat each revealed multiset of values as a signal and linearize Bob's best response by introducing a variable that upper-bounds both possible payoffs (take visible max or take hidden). Minimizing the sum of those per-signal variables yields the equilibrium value of the zero-sum game.

Main techniques used:
- Enumerate all dice outcomes and all possible reveal choices.
- Build a linear program with equality constraints for Alice's behavior strategy and inequality constraints that capture Bob's per-signal best response.
- Solve the LP with a two-phase simplex method implemented from scratch (no external libraries).
- Validate against the two-dice game value from the statement using assertions.
